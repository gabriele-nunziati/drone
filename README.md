GROUP PROJECT ON AUTOMATICS CONTROLS T 

Title: Balance Control of a Planar Drone (Controllo dell’assetto di un Drone Planare)
January 2021

For this project, a control system for adjusting the attitude of a drone subject to a crosswind is modeled.
Specifically, the angle of inclination θ of the drone with respect to our inertial reference system 0XY is to be acted upon.
The solution is designed with MatLab.
